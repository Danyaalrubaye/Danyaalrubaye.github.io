        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a dedicated and driven pre-medical student with a passion for bridging gaps in healthcare through clinical experience, community engagement, and academic excellence. After immigrating to the United States at the age of 12, I navigated the challenges of adapting to a new education system, ultimately leveraging my resilience and resourcefulness to thrive academically and personally. Embracing a growth mindset, I sought out mentors and educational resources to bridge knowledge gaps, fueling my drive to pursue a career in medicine. These formative experiences instilled in me the importance of perseverance and self-advocacy, qualities that continue to shape my academic and professional journey.

Currently, I serve as the president of the AMSA chapter at Norco College, where I have cultivated a supportive network for pre-health students through initiatives such as Women's Month, workshops on healthcare disparities, and mentorship programs. Leading AMSA has allowed me to refine my leadership skills, coordinate events, and foster a culture of inclusivity and empowerment. Additionally, I spearheaded projects like creating care packages for unhoused individuals and collaborated with AMSA's Health Justice Action Committee to examine the disparities in postpartum and prenatal care, presenting our findings at the Future Physicians for Change Conference. This experience highlighted the importance of advocacy in healthcare and the impact of community-driven initiatives. Moreover, organizing these initiatives has underscored the significance of clear communication, project management, and the ability to inspire and mobilize others.

Clinically, I gained hands-on patient care experience through the COPE Health Scholars Program at Riverside Community Hospital, where I rotated across multiple units, honing my communication and bedside manner. As a medical assistant at an internal medicine clinic, I further developed my patient interaction skills, learning to navigate the nuances of clinical care in a diverse, fast-paced environment. This experience underscored the importance of cultural competency and patient-centered communication, particularly in underserved populations. Witnessing firsthand the disparities faced by vulnerable patients deepened my commitment to addressing health inequities. Additionally, the opportunity to work alongside physicians and nurses has provided me with invaluable insights into interdisciplinary collaboration and the critical role of effective communication in patient care. These experiences have further reinforced my desire to become a physician who actively contributes to patient education and promotes preventive care as essential components of healthcare.

In addition to my clinical work, I am deeply interested in the intersection of neuroscience and public health. I have explored topics like the influence of neurotoxicants on brain development, the genetic underpinnings of Fragile X syndrome, and the implications of FMRP in neurodevelopmental disorders. My research efforts extend to data analysis, as I have contributed to projects at Keck Graduate Institute focused on drug repurposing and population health research, utilizing statistical tools like R to derive meaningful insights. Engaging in research has enhanced my analytical skills and provided a platform to apply scientific principles to real-world health challenges. This academic work has not only deepened my understanding of complex biological systems but also reinforced my interest in pursuing research that bridges clinical practice and public health initiatives. Additionally, my research experience has fostered a deeper appreciation for evidence-based medicine and the importance of integrating research findings into clinical practice to improve patient outcomes.

My dedication to academic growth is matched by my commitment to community service and advocacy. Whether organizing initiatives for AMSA, volunteering in emergency departments, or engaging in research that addresses health disparities, I remain steadfast in my mission to become a physician who advocates for equitable, compassionate care for all. As I continue my journey toward medical school, I am committed to further expanding my clinical and research expertise, advocating for marginalized populations, and contributing to a more inclusive and equitable healthcare system. I aspire to leverage my experiences to not only impact individual patients but also to contribute to systemic change that addresses the root causes of health inequities, fostering a healthcare landscape that is truly accessible and just for all. Looking forward, I aim to explore opportunities to further my understanding of healthcare policy and its implications for patient care, with the goal of contri.<br><br>
